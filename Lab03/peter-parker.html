            <h3>Bio</h3>
            <p>Peter Parker was an orphaned teenage boy who lived in Queens, New York with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. He was a shy boy, but highly intelligent and excelled in science. He was often teased by other more popular kids like longtime nemesis Flash Thompson, but his life was soon to change on a visit to the science museum.</p>
